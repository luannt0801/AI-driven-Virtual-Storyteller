A long-haired blonde princess was trapped in a castle guarded by a dragon. The prince saved the princess. They lived happily together and ruled the kingdom. One night their long-lost friend, the dragon called Kreygasm, appeared and told him he had killed Kreygasm and had given him the key to the dragon's lair. It was only that time that he revealed to Kreygasm that he was possessed by his demonic self.

It was this dark, frightening reality that brought Kreygasm back to life for the first time. Soon, Kreygasm became a hero. It has ever since been taught that his demonic self is stronger than those who take it down.
